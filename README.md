# Maze Game (2022 Project)

## Description

**Maze Game** is a project realised during my second year at university.
The assignment was to develop a linux console video game, The game is set in
a maze, and the player must discover hints throughout his journey to find out
his objective(s) to win the game.

The team was composed of :
- LANNOY Theo (me, obviously :D)
- EVERAERE Emma
- MICHELOT Damien
- CHERGUI Rayan

Have in look in folder `project/` to see files related to the assignment given.
The [specs](./project/Subject2022.pdf) are also available in that folder.

## Dependencies

To compile the program, the *JSON Simple* library is needed. A standalone version
has been provided in the folder `lib/`.

## Execution

GNU Make utility is also mandatory in order to compile and execute the program.
On a Linux machine, you can install it with this command :
```console
$ sudo apt install make
```
If this is not working, please consult [this link](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

The following commands must be executed in the project root folder.

Compile source & tests files :
```console
$ make cls
```

Run the program from compiled files :
```console
$ make run algo=1 # Start the game with maze generation algorithm #1
```

Generate an archive `game.jar` of the program (located in `bin/`):
```console
$ make jar
```

Run the program through the archive created :
```
$ make play algo=2 # Start the game with algorithm #2
```

Generate JavaDoc in folder `docs/` :
```console
$ make docs
```

Delete all files generated by make :
```console
$ make clean
```

## Testing

Unit tests execution relies on the framework JUnit 4. A standalone version
is available in the folder `lib/`.

Use the following command to run tests :
```console
$ make tests
```

If you want to run tests for a specific class only :
```console
$ make test class=game.maze.TestMaze # Start tests for class TestMaze
```
